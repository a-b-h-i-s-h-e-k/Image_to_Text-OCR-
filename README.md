# Image-to-Text OCR
- This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on an image to extract text. The key steps involve using the pytesseract library to convert image-based text into machine-readable text.

# Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies:
- pytesseract: A Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR Engine. It allows text extraction from images.

# Installation: pip install pytesseract
- PIL: Python Imaging Library for image manipulation tasks.
- matplotlib: A plotting library used to visualize images and graphs.
- re: The regular expression module for pattern matching within text.

# Steps Involved
- Import Necessary Modules: The notebook imports essential libraries such as matplotlib for visualization, PIL for image manipulation, pytesseract for OCR, and re for regex-based text processing.

# Loading the Image:
- An image is loaded from the specified directory (e.g., /kaggle/input/testimage).
- The image file to be processed is listed and printed.

# Text Extraction Using OCR:
- The notebook uses pytesseract to extract text from the loaded image.

# Regex-based Processing:
- After extracting the text, you can use regular expressions to search and process specific parts of the extracted text.

# Example
- The code includes examples of how to:
- Install required packages.
- Use pytesseract for text extraction from images.
- Process the extracted text using regular expressions.
